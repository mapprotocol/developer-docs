## Introduction

Atlas is a chain that utilizes the Proof of Stake (POS) consensus algorithm. Here's how it works:

- Stake MAPO to become a validator
- Validators vote to select the validators for each epoch's validation block
- At the end of each epoch, rewards are distributed based on the voting results

## Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements:

1. Machine Configuration
   MAP is a Proof of Stake network with different hardware requirements compared to Proof of Work networks. Proof of
   Stake consensus is less CPU-intensive but more sensitive to network connectivity and latency. Here is a standard
   requirement list for running a validator on the MAP network:
    - Memory: 16GB RAM
    - CPU: Quad-core 2.5 GHz (64-bit)
    - Disk: 256GB SSD storage with an additional auxiliary HDD
    - Network: At least 100Mb input/output Ethernet with fiber internet connection, ideal redundancy connections, and HA
      switches

2. Amount of MAPO
   Your account needs to have at least 1,000,000 MAPO.

### Software Requirements

Building Atlas requires git, Go (version 1.14 or higher), and a C compiler. You can install them using your preferred
package manager.

## How to become a new validator

To ensure the security of your assets, we require you to set up some necessary identity verification parameters to
become a validator. We also have corresponding thresholds to filter out those who are truly committed to contributing to
the chain. Of course, we will reward those individuals accordingly. The following steps are considered your initial
setup as a validator, as you only need to perform these steps once to become a validator. You do not need to perform
these steps a second time unless you unregister as a validator or cancel the corresponding operation to avoid wasting
your gas fees.

### Step 1: Create Account

In this step, you need to store your identity information in the corresponding management contract, which will manage
your account, keys, and metadata. The purpose of this step is to ensure the security of the locked MAPO by authorizing
alternative keys for signing proofs, voting, and validation. By doing so, you can continue to participate in the
protocol while maintaining access to the keys that store your locked MAPO. You need to use the `createAccount` command
to perform the above operations. For more detailed information about the `createAccount` command, please refer
to [here](/docs/base/mapo-relay-chain/marker/common_en.md#createaccount).

### Step 2: Authorization

Authorize an address to sign consensus messages on behalf of your account. This authorized address is called the signer.
As the name suggests, the signer is only responsible for signing, and your rewards will not be issued to the signer but
to the account created in the previous step.

### Step 3: Lock MAP

The threshold for becoming a validator is to lock 1,000,000 MAPO into the corresponding management smart contract. This
locked MAP will be used for future penalties and is one of the conditions for election. You need to use the `LockedMAP`
command to perform the above operation. For more detailed information about the `LockedMAP` command, please refer
to [here](/docs/base/mapo-relay-chain/marker/common_en.md#lockedmap).

### Step 4: Validator Registration

This step is a key step in registering as a new validator. You need to use the `register` command to perform the above
operation. For more detailed information about the `register` command, please refer
to [here](/docs/base/mapo-relay-chain/marker/validator_en.md#register). At this point, you will have successfully
registered as a validator. Next, you can try to vote for yourself. For more information on how to vote, please refer
to [here](/docs/base/mapo-relay-chain/marker/vote_en.md#vote).

### Step 5: Voting

A validator must have at least 0.001 proportion of the total votes to be considered for election. Therefore, a validator
cannot have zero votes. We can either vote for ourselves using our validator account or have other validators or voters
vote for us. Since we have locked 1,000,000 MAP in Step 3, it is wise to vote for ourselves.

## Example

### Start Your Node

Before starting the node, you need to build Atlas. Please refer
to [here](/docs/base/mapo-relay-chain/nodes/run-a-node_en.md#clone-the-code-repository-and-build) for instructions on
how
to build Atlas.

You will need two keystore files, one for the account used for staking, called `account`, and one for the signer used
for signing consensus blocks.

If you want your Atlas node to run in the background without hanging, you can use a combination of nohup and &, or tools
like screen. Below, we will demonstrate using screen.

`account.json`: keystore file for the account
`signer.json`: keystore file for the signer

`--miner.validator`: specify the address of the signer
`--port 30321`: make sure the port is open on the firewall

```shell
./atlas --datadir ./node --syncmode "full" --port 30321 --v5disc --mine --miner.validator 0x98efa292822eb7b3045c491e8ae4e82b3b1ac005 --unlock 0x98efa292822eb7b3045c491e8ae4e82b3b1ac005

```

After starting the node, it will connect to the network through built-in bootstrap nodes and synchronize block data.

### Verify

After completing the registration steps for a validator, let's now verify if you have become a validator.

```shell
./marker getTotalVotesForEligibleValidators --rpcaddr https://rpc.maplabs.io

```

### Voting

The number of votes cannot exceed the locked votes.

For more information about voting and elections, please click on the following links:
[Voting](/docs/base/mapo-relay-chain/marker/vote_en.md#vote)
[Elections](/docs/base/mapo-relay-chain/protocol/election_en.md)

Now let's vote for a validator. The voting command is as follows:

```shell
./marker vote --rpcaddr https://rpc.maplabs.io --keystore ./account.json --target 0x73bc690093b9dd0400c91886184a60cc127b2c33 --voteNum 1000000

```

### Validating the Vote

Now, let's validate if the vote is valid.

```shell
./marker getTotalVotesForEligibleValidators --rpcaddr https://rpc.maplabs.io

INFO [07-08|15:21:45.881] Validator:                               addr=0xeA9efaA232A4567EaC21C8C096f8BfF84595A244 vote amount=1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

INFO [07-08|15:21:45.881] Validator:                               addr=0x73bC690093b9dD0400c91886184A60cC127b2c33 vote amount=1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

```

From the results, it appears that I have successfully voted for myself, but it's not enough. We need to call the RPC in
the next epoch to ultimately determine if we have been selected as a validator eligible for block production. Here's how
it looks:

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"istanbul_getValidators","params":[],"id":1}' https://rpc.maplabs.io

# Output
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "result": [
        "0x5d643dfb9ae372ce4fdbc80890156e2cd8290846",
        "0xa53516d49a72019692ac69cb42641942597654f6",
        "0x6acdc02223100189d82a958d888f54fa27d60e8a",
        "0xea9efaa232a4567eac21c8c096f8bff84595a244",
        "0x98efa292822eb7b3045c491e8ae4e82b3b1ac005" # our signer
    ]
}
```
