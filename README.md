# MAPO Protocol Development documentation

This document aims to help you understand MAPO, how to use it to build decentralized applications, and how to interconnect a blockchain with MAPO. The document introduces the concept of MAPO, explains the MAPO technology stack, and provides use cases for MAPO applications.

Based on open-source community guidelines, you can propose new topics, add new content, and provide examples where you think it would be helpful. All documents can be edited through GitHub and are stored on decentralized storage facilities like `Arweave`. If you are unsure about how to proceed, please follow the [instructions](docs/editing-markdown.md).

If this is your first time diving into MAPO development, it is recommended that you start from the beginning. This will not only familiarize you with MAPO but also delve into the underlying blockchain technologies and concepts like ZK, providing you with a new understanding of peer-to-peer code trust.
